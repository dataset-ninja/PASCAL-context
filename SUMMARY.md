**PASCAL Context Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 10103 images with 65937 labeled objects belonging to 459 different classes including *person*, *unknown*, *tree*, and other: *sky*, *building*, *ground*, *wall*, *grass*, *floor*, *table*, *pole*, *chair*, *car*, *dog*, *road*, *fence*, *cat*, *light*, *water*, *cloth*, *sofa*, *bottle*, *window*, *mountain*, *picture*, *bird*, *pottedplant*, *aeroplane*, and 431 more.

Images in the PASCAL Context dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (4998 images) and *val* (5105 images). The dataset was released in 2014 by the Stanford University.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
