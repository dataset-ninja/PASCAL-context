The VOC2010 data includes images obtained from the "flickr" website. Use of these images must respect the corresponding terms of use:

- [&#34;flickr&#34; terms of use](https://www.flickr.com/help/terms)

For the purposes of the challenge, the identity of the images in the database, e.g. source and name of owner, has been obscured. Details of the contributor of each image can be found in the annotation to be included in the final release of the data, after completion of the challenge. Any queries about the use or ownership of the data should be addressed to the [organizers](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2010/index.html#organizers).
