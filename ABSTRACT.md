This dataset is a **set of additional annotations for PASCAL VOC 2010**. It goes beyond the original PASCAL semantic segmentation task by providing annotations for the whole scene. The authors of [the paper](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/~roozbeh/pascal-context/mottaghi_et_al_cvpr14.pdf) studies the role of context in existing state of-the-art detection and segmentation approaches. Towards this goal, they labeled every pixel of PASCAL VOC 2010 detection challenge with a semantic category.

Humans perceive the visual world effortlessly. We look at a complex and cluttered scene and know that the tiny object on the table is a fork and not the tail of an elephant. We know that the object hanging on the wall is mor e likely to be a picture or even a moose head than a car, and that a highly deformable entity stretching on the sofa is more likely to be a cat than a tiger. Context is a statistical property of the world we live in and provides critical information to help us solve perceptual inference tasks faster and more accurately. Cognition-based studies have proved the effect of context in various perceptual tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation and scene classification. Authors of the paper have analyzed the effect of context in detection and segmentation approaches.
