**PASCAL Context Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 10103 images with 65937 labeled objects belonging to 459 different classes including *person*, *unknown*, *tree*, and other: *sky*, *building*, *ground*, *wall*, *grass*, *floor*, *table*, *pole*, *chair*, *car*, *dog*, *road*, *fence*, *cat*, *light*, *water*, *cloth*, *sofa*, *bottle*, *window*, *mountain*, *picture*, *bird*, *pottedplant*, *aeroplane*, and 431 more.

Images in the PASCAL Context dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *val* (5105 images) and *train* (4998 images). The dataset was released in 2014 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Stanford University</span>.
